# Debunking the Myth of Early Death in Left-Handers

This repository contains the project "Debunking the Myth of Early Death in Left-Handers," which was completed as part of the traineeship program with MedTourEasy in 2023.

## Project Overview

There is a popular myth that left-handed people die younger than right-handed people. This project aims to investigate the credibility of this assertion using data analysis and statistical methodologies. The primary goal is to assess whether there is a significant difference in the lifespan of left-handed and right-handed individuals.

## Objectives and Deliverables

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Investigate the correlation between handedness and lifespan.
2. Explore changing patterns of left-handedness over different time periods and geographical regions.
3. Analyze the probability of reaching specific ages at the time of death based on handedness using Bayesian statistics.

### Deliverables
- Graphical representation of male and female left-handedness rates vs. Age.
- Comparison of rates of left-handedness over time.
- Overall probability of left-handedness.
- Probability of death at a certain age given that one is left-handed.
- Summary report highlighting the main findings and conclusions, supported by relevant graphs and statistics.

## Methodology

The project utilizes the following tools and methodologies:
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation using matplotlib
- **Statistical Analysis**: Bayesian statistics to estimate probabilities
- **Data Source**: National Geographic survey data from 1986

## Project Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `Final_Report_of_Traineeship_Program_2023_[Tejasva_Maurya].pdf`: Detailed report of the project with methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions.

## Key Findings

1. **Graphical Analysis**: Visualizations of the data revealed fluctuations in left-handedness rates across different age groups.
2. **Statistical Insights**: Bayesian statistics were used to compute the likelihood of being left-handed or right-handed based on the age at death.
3. **Conclusion**: The analysis debunked the myth that left-handers have a shorter lifespan. There was no significant difference in the average age at death between right-handers and left-handers.

## Future Scope

The project opens several avenues for further research:
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Tracking hand preferences and health outcomes over a lifetime.
- **Genetic and Environmental Factors**: Exploring the interplay of genetics, environment, and culture on handedness and lifespan.
- **Personalized Healthcare**: Developing tailored health-promotion strategies based on handedness-related risks.
